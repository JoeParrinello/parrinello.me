        <p>I've been programming since 2008, when I was a freshman in high school. I started cutting my teeth with PASCAL, but later moved on to Java. In 2012, I came to NJIT, met a whole bunch of cool people who knew more than me, and began to play with all the cool technologies I could find.</p>

            <p>Most recently, I had a summer internship at Merck & Co., working under the Applied Technology unit, where I got exposure to a bunch of cool tools: Node.js, Angular JS, and Neo4j. I developed in an agile environment, which was a whole new experience, and one I enjoyed and crave for.</p>
