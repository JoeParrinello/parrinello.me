Tasked with creating an abstract data type that can model numbers larger than the traditional int or double. The numbers were designed to be compared to numbers, basic arithmetic, and exponentiation. Had to be designed in a way where the number could be implemented with either a Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List, or Array.
